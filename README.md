<h2>Hello!_</h2>
<p>I am a passionate software engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in computer science. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I am currently in the last term of my study Diploma in full-stack web Development at Red River College in Winnipeg, MB. 

In this program, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages, databases, and fundamental IT concepts. I am eager to apply these skills in real-world settings, and I am excited to embark on a co-op term that will allow me to do so.

I am committed to continuous learning and have recently been expanding my knowledge in deployment and cloud technologies. This commitment to staying up-to-date with industry trends reflects my dedication to delivering high-quality work and adapting to new challenges.</p>
